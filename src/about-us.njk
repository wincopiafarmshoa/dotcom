            <p>Located in North Laurel, Maryland (Howard County), Wincopia Farms is at the heart of a vibrant, diverse region – Baltimore, Washington, Annapolis and the Chesapeake Bay are all near at hand, and the region’s expansive highway network makes getting around easy.</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/about-us-body.png" />
            <p>Wincopia Farms is a tight knit community of 220 homeowners. Family-friendly and business professionals alike live and work in the community. The neighborhood’s hidden treasure — a pedestrian tunnel that extends under Gorman Rd — provides the community access to the county’s highly rated public schools.</p>
            <p>Our 124 acre grounds are surrounded by beautiful trees and landscaping. The neighborhood enjoys 2 large green field spaces, ideal for community events, open play, and sports.</p>
            <p>The area retains its rural feel, in part because there are still plenty of nearby pastures and farmland, including Gorman Farm, which operates a CSA and a pick-your-own strawberries patch.</p>
