            <p>The HOA Board of Directors consists of a maximum of five directors who are elected by the community, to two-year terms. Elections are held during the Annual HOA meeting to fill any vacancies on the Board of Directors. The members of the Board of Directors manage the affairs of the Association.</p>
            <p>The directors hold no official government office, and they have no authority beyond that defined in the HOAâ€™s Bylaws. The Board considers matters that arise within the Community and otherwise handles the day-to-day operation of the HOA. As such, any issue that falls under the purview and responsibility of the HOA (see the Covenants and Bylaws) may be brought to the attention of the Board for consideration and resolution.</p>
